The integration of Python and *R* has been going on for a while and the benefits tend to increase. Earlier, we took a look at loading Python's [*keras* package](https://seslezak.github.io/Keras01/) into *R*. We found the exercise to be worthwhile and the results impressive, but there were some quirks that generally aren't mentioned in the official documentation. Using Python's signature libraries -- *seaborn*, *matplotlib*, and *pandas* -- provide similar benefits and challenges.

Of course, all this is made possible by *R*'s *reticulate* package, which enables *R* and *Python* to play together. So we start by loading *reticulate* for the functionality and *MASS* for the data sets we will use in this simple exercise.

```r
library(reticulate)
library(MASS)
```

We move next to the Frankencode. I still can't get used to seeing *R* code and Python code intermingling on the same line, but I supposed I will have to get used to it.

```r
sns <- import('seaborn')
plt <- import('matplotlib.pyplot')
pd <- import('pandas')
```
Having gone through difficulties using *keras* in *R*, I anticipated problems when working the Python libraries in the *R* environment. It didn't take me long to encounter the main problem. When importing the Python libraries, *R* threw off this mysterious and unhelpful error message:

>This application failed to start because R could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in ''.
>Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Much googling and poring through StackOverflow led me to understand that it was a problem with Anaconda3, PyCharm, TexWorks, and MiKTex. A [number of solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41994485/error-could-not-find-or-load-the-qt-platform-plugin-windows-while-using-matplo) were suggested, everything from changing environment variables to removing Qt and PyQt then reinstalling. None of these worked but they pointed me in the right direction.

I decided the best way to start was to reinstall Anaconda3 with the latest version. When I did, I ran Anaconda Navigator and noticed a new program called *qtconsole*. I found this hopeful so I ran the console, went back to *R*, and imported the libraries. This time it all worked well.

It turns out I had this problem because I was working in *R* 3.4.4. Now that I have upgraded to *R* 3.5.0 I don't need to run Anaconda3 and *qtconsole*. The libraries run straight out of *R*.

There are a couple data sets in base *R* that illustrate what these libraries do well, so I created an *R* object and got back to plugging it into Python. The`r_to_py()` function is key to this operation, which creates a heatmap graphic from *Seaborn*. The results using the `attitude` data set in *Seaborn* are pretty impressive. Score one for Python!

 ```r
df <- attitude
sns$heatmap(r_to_py(df), fmt = "g", cmap = 'viridis')
plt$show()
 ```

I also wanted to try `pairplot()` in *Seaborn* so I worked up an example using the *synth.te* data set. It is a synthetic data set which I chose because it has a binary categorical coded 0 and 1, so the pairplots worked out nicely.

```r
sns$pairplot(r_to_py(synth.te), hue = 'yc')
plt$show()
```

Thanks to the [datascience+](https://datascienceplus.com/) online community for bringing *R* and Python together.
